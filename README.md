The "Digital Clock" project implemented in Python utilizes the `tkinter` library for creating a graphical user interface and the `time` module to handle time-related operations. 
This simple yet effective project results in a visually appealing digital clock display. 
The program initiates a tkinter window featuring a large, bold label showcasing the current time in hours, minutes, seconds, and AM/PM format. 
The time is dynamically updated every second, providing a real-time representation of the system time. The sleek design, with a black background and white text, enhances readability and aesthetics. 
This project serves as an excellent introduction to basic GUI programming in Python, offering users a practical example of integrating time-related functionalities within a graphical interface. 
With its straightforward implementation, the Digital Clock project provides a foundation for learners interested in exploring more advanced GUI applications and time-related functionalities in Python.
